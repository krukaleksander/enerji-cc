# Enerji-cc Panel

## What is it?

At the beginning it was very simple webpage which I created to count appointments made by Call Center in Enerji.
It was plain table with '+' (add) and '-' (remove) buttons. And it was really all.
Today it not only counts appointments done in particular day, it also store data from week, month, and all meettings done by employee, and much much more.

## Main functions:

- Counting appointments
- Notification about lack of contacts to call
- Special calculator: reckon loan payment - you have to know only howe mutch client is paying monthly for energy
- Table with information about experts who are going to customer home / company
- News section - it's a space where employer, or employees can put some important information, or notification.
- Useful section - here are some other tools which can be useful at work.
